          I'm passionate about coding because it allows me to combine analytical
          thinking with creativity to build solutions that make a real impact. I
          enjoy breaking down complex problems, exploring different approaches,
          and collaborating with others to find the best path forward. Coding
          challenges me to be persistent and constantly learn, while also giving
          me the freedom to create. For me, it’s the perfect blend of logic,
          innovation, and teamwork — all driven by a strong problem-solving
          mindset.
